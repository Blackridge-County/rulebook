# Immersion 

Maintaining immersion is key to ensuring a realistic and engaging experience for everyone in our 1890s world. All players are expected to follow these guidelines:

***

## Stay In-Character (IC)

* Your character must always act, speak, and react in a manner consistent with their background, personality, and the 1890s setting.

* Breaking character—such as suddenly speaking or behaving in a modern way, or dropping your roleplay mannerisms—is prohibited. Consistency is crucial for immersion.

* You may not reference or react to events, knowledge, or information that your character could not realistically know.

* Refrain from pulling people up on rules mid scene for example: "you cant do that cause its against the rules"  

***

## Out-of-Character (OOC) Communication

* Avoid talking about out-of-county events or using OOC information in-character. Your character cannot know about things outside the county unless they are naturally aware of them.

* Using /me commands for OOC reasons, personal messages, or anything that does not benefit roleplay is prohibited. /me is for emotes and actions that enhance the RP experience only.

***

## Character Creation & Appearance

* All rules regarding character creation and clothing must be followed. This includes:

* Era-appropriate names, hair color, and appearance.

* Clothing reflecting the time period and roleplay type of your character.

* Avoiding exaggerated or fantastical looks that break immersion.

* Characters that do not follow these rules may be asked to adjust their appearance before participating in roleplay.

***

## Knowledge and Setting Awareness

* Do not reference modern technology, famous people, or events that someone in the 1890s would not know.

* Avoid mentioning out-of-character knowledge, such as server mechanics or other player activities, in-character.

* Roleplay should reflect the limitations and realities of the time period—your character’s understanding of the world must be consistent with history.

***

## Roleplay Checks

* You may NOT roleplay check other characters to verify their intentions, story, or authenticity, but this must be done in-character and cannot be a form of metagaming.

* Do not assume OOC knowledge when questioning or reacting to another player’s actions.

***

## General Guidelines

* Always prioritize immersion in every interaction. Ask yourself: “Would someone in 1890 actually say or do this?”

* Consistency is key—your actions, speech, and clothing should all reflect the era and your character’s background.

* Breaking these rules can result in warnings or administrative action, as immersion is essential to the experience of all players.
