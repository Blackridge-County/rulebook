# 💭 Immersion 

Maintaining immersion is key to ensuring a realistic and engaging experience for everyone in our 1890s world. All players are expected to follow these guidelines:

***

## ✅ Stay In-Character (IC)

* Your character must always act, speak, and react in a manner consistent with their background, personality, and the 1890s setting.

* Breaking character—such as suddenly speaking or behaving in a modern way, or dropping your roleplay mannerisms—is prohibited. Consistency is crucial for immersion.

* You may not reference or react to events, knowledge, or information that your character could not realistically know.

* Refrain from pulling people up on rules mid scene for example: "you cant do that cause its against the rules"  

***

## ❌ Out-of-Character (OOC) Communication

* Avoid talking about out-of-county events or using OOC information in-character. Your character cannot know about things outside the county unless they are naturally aware of them.

* Using /me commands for OOC reasons, personal messages, or anything that does not benefit roleplay is prohibited. /me is for emotes and actions that enhance the RP experience only.

***

## 👘 Character Creation & Appearance

* All rules regarding character creation and clothing must be followed. This includes:

* Era-appropriate names, hair color, and appearance.

* Clothing reflecting the time period and roleplay type of your character.

* Avoiding exaggerated or fantastical looks that break immersion.

* Characters that do not follow these rules may be asked to adjust their appearance before participating in roleplay.

***

## 📕 Knowledge and Setting Awareness

* Do not reference modern technology, famous people, or events that someone in the 1890s would not know.

* Avoid mentioning out-of-character knowledge, such as server mechanics or other player activities, in-character.

* Roleplay should reflect the limitations and realities of the time period—your character’s understanding of the world must be consistent with history.

***

## 🔍 Roleplay Checks

* You may NOT roleplay check other characters to verify their intentions, story, or authenticity, but this must be done in-character and cannot be a form of metagaming.

* Do not assume OOC knowledge when questioning or reacting to another player’s actions.

***

## 📜 General Guidelines

* Always prioritize immersion in every interaction. Ask yourself: “Would someone in 1890 actually say or do this?”

* Consistency is key—your actions, speech, and clothing should all reflect the era and your character’s background.

* Breaking these rules can result in warnings or administrative action, as immersion is essential to the experience of all players.

***

# 💊 Medical Roleplay 

Proper medical roleplay is essential to maintaining immersion and realism in our server. All players are expected to follow these rules when injured, being treated, or interacting with medical scenarios:

***

## 😖 Roleplay Your Injuries

* React realistically to injuries. If your character is shot, stabbed, or otherwise hurt, you must act as someone in that situation would—showing pain, struggling, or being physically affected.

* Vocalization is important. Groans, cries, or other sounds of pain are required to convey your character’s condition accurately.

***

## 😭 React to Medical Treatment

* When receiving medical attention, you must roleplay reactions to procedures such as injections, broken bones being set, or other treatments. Flinching, wincing, or struggling when appropriate adds to realism.

* Do not ignore the sensations your character would naturally feel during medical care.

***

## ❗ Communication Restrictions

* You may not speak in-character unless addressing a doctor, medic, or person providing treatment. Any attempt to speak to others while incapacitated breaks immersion.

* Out-of-character information, such as who shot you or why you were injured, cannot be shared with friends or group members. Your character realistically wouldn’t have this information unless witnessed firsthand.

***

## 💭 Using /me for Immersion

* Always use /me commands to enhance medical roleplay. Examples include:

* /me starts foaming at the mouth

* /me begins to shake uncontrollably

* /me cries out in pain as the fracture is set

Your actions should reflect the severity of your injuries and the treatment being applied.

***

## 📜 General Guidelines

* Immersion is key. Acting as if you are fine while critically injured is not allowed.

* Cooperate with medics. Medical roleplay works best when both parties commit to realism.

* Failure to properly roleplay injuries, reactions, or treatment may result in warnings or administrative action, as it impacts the experience of all players.
