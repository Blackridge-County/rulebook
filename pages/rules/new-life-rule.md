# 🔁 New Life Rule (NLR)

The New Life Rule (NLR) governs how memory and character behavior are handled after a character has been incapacitated. When NLR is triggered, your character may experience partial or complete memory loss of the events that led to their incapacitation. This rule exists to protect immersion, fairness, and ongoing roleplay.

## When NLR Takes Effect

***NLR applies under the following circumstances:***

* If you choose to respawn while downed (such as using the respawn option), your character is considered to have lost all knowledge of the events leading up to their incapacitation.

* Players are not permitted to respawn if active roleplay is still occurring nearby or if medical staff have announced they are responding.

* If you remain incapacitated for an extended and reasonable period with no medical assistance arriving, you are expected to respawn. Remaining downed solely to preserve memory is considered poor roleplay.

***

## When NLR Does Not Take Effect

***NLR does not automatically apply in the following situations:***

* If you are revived by another player (Doctor) or transported to an in-character medical facility, you may retain memory of the incident unless you choose otherwise.

* A conscious witness who remained present for the entire encounter may remind your character of what occurred through roleplay.

***

## Re-Engagement Restrictions

***After being revived or respawning, players must not:***

* Actively pursue revenge or attempt to retaliate against those involved unless reintroduced through legitimate roleplay.

* Share specific details of the incident that your character would not realistically remember.

* Return to the location of the incident or engage in hostilities with the same individuals for a minimum of 45 minutes.

* Linger in or reinsert themselves into the area without making reasonable efforts to roleplay leaving the scene.

***

## Body Interaction & Scene Control

* Camping a downed player’s body to block medical intervention or control outcomes is prohibited.

* Manipulating bodies for the purpose of denying roleplay opportunities is not allowed.

***

##Injury Clarification

* Targeting or roleplaying head wounds does not automatically result in memory loss. Severe head injuries may be treated in-character as serious neck or cranial trauma, but do not inherently erase memory.

* Visual dismemberment is considered a game mechanic and does not override roleplay continuity on its own.

***

## Special Roleplay Conditions

* Characters affected by supernatural influence, such as vampiric mesmerization, are encouraged to roleplay confusion, fragmented memory, or hazy recollection rather than total awareness.

***

## Final Notes

NLR is designed to encourage meaningful consequences while allowing roleplay to continue organically. Players are expected to act in good faith and prioritize storytelling over advantage.

If you are unsure how NLR applies in a situation, pause roleplay and contact staff for guidance.
