# 📝 Blackridge County RP Guide & Reporting Procedures


 ## 📗 Handling Problems & Conflicts

Whenever possible, resolve disputes in-character. This keeps the story immersive and avoids unnecessary rule reports.

* If you’re unsure whether something breaks a rule, check the server documentation or submit a ticket for guidance.

* Minor misunderstandings, disagreements, or character rudeness usually do not count as violations. Only serious incidents like harassment, hate speech, or rule-breaking actions qualify.

***

## 📤 Reporting Incidents

Reports should only be made after an RP scene ends, unless the situation is extremely dangerous (e.g., cheating, harassment, sexual misconduct).

***To make a valid report:***

* Include unedited screenshots or video footage. Edited clips will be ignored or treated as misleading.

* Make sure audio from both your microphone and the game is captured.

* Add timestamps or context so staff can follow what happened.

* Very short clips (under 20–30 seconds) may not provide enough evidence.

***Bugs & Exploits:***

* Report immediately. Waiting can result in penalties.

***Deadlines:***

* Reports must be submitted within 3 days of the incident. Critical cases may be exceptions.

All tickets are reviewed at staff discretion, based on how the event affects roleplay and the server environment.

## 🎁 Comp Claims

If a bug or rule violation causes you to lose items or currency, you may be eligible for compensation.

***To request compensation:***

* Provide clear proof showing the lost items or money, such as video or screenshots.

* Evidence will be checked against server logs to confirm authenticity.

## ❌ What Not to Report

* Minor RP disagreements or confusion about rules.

* Incidents intended as revenge reporting.

Tip: If something feels unclear, ask staff before escalating. Not every conflict needs a formal report.

 ## 👤 Staying in Character

Maintaining immersion is essential. Do not break RP to address rule violations, confront other players, or report bugs.

* Scenes involving rule-breaking should be played out unless the event is extreme.

* Only after the scene concludes should you submit a report.

Remember: Your character should act naturally, without knowledge from outside the game affecting decisions.
