# Robbing

Robbery roleplay is intended to create tension, character development, and meaningful storylines, not to function as a quick or repetitive way to gain money or items. All robberies must be conducted with immersion, effort, and fairness in mind.

***

## Purpose & Intent

* The primary goal of any robbery must be story-driven roleplay, not loot-focused behavior.

* Robberies should be engaging for everyone involved, with dialogue, interaction, and believable escalation—not silent or rushed transactions.

* Low-effort robberies that exist solely to take items or cash may result in administrative action.

## Hostility & Engagement

* Hostile intent must be clearly shown before initiating a robbery (e.g., drawing a weapon, issuing commands, verbal threats).

* When the victim is present, they must be given a brief but reasonable chance to react before the robbery proceeds.

* Robbery RP should unfold naturally and not feel forced or instantaneous.

***

## Killing vs. Robbing

* You may not rob and kill the same player. You must choose one or the other.

* Victims should not be harmed after a robbery unless they present a clear and immediate threat to the robber’s escape or safety.

***

## Searching & Looting Rules

You may only rob one source per victim during a robbery.

Example: If you search saddlebags, you may not also search the player’s inventory.

* Only one person per group may search each victim.

* Unguarded inventories (such as saddlebags, wagons, stashes, or campfires) may be robbed without prior engagement as long as the owner is not present or does not have line of sight.

***

## Chain Robbing & Cooldowns

Chain robbing is prohibited.

* A 30-minute cooldown is required between player robberies.

* If multiple players are being held at gunpoint in a single, continuous scene—and you clearly outnumber them—you may rob each victim as part of that one robbery.

* Repeated, low-effort robberies within a short time frame or in close proximity will be considered chain robbing, even if different victims are involved.

***

## Hostages & Group Robberies

* You may rob a player you are actively using as a hostage during a larger robbery (such as a bank or store robbery).

* Hostage scenarios must still follow all other robbery and immersion rules.

***

## Restrictions & Fair Play

* You may not rob a player while they are in a menu, storefront, or otherwise unable to respond.

* Robbery roleplay must remain fair, immersive, and respectful of the victim’s ability to participate.

***

## Roleplay Quality Standards

* Robbery RP must include meaningful dialogue and interaction.

* Avoid low-effort commands such as “hands” with no further engagement.

* Both the robber and the victim are expected to contribute to an immersive and believable scene.

***

## Reputation & Consequences

* ***Robbery has lasting consequences. If your character becomes known as a robber, outlaw, or highwayman, this reputation will shape how others treat you in roleplay.***

* Citizens may become fearful, uncooperative, or openly hostile toward your character. Shopkeepers may refuse service, townsfolk may report suspicious behavior, and law enforcement may be quicker to suspect or pursue you.

* Your reputation can spread organically through roleplay. Word travels fast in a county—people talk, rumors spread, and past actions are remembered.

* Being recognized as a known criminal may result in increased law enforcement attention, harsher responses during encounters, or fewer opportunities for peaceful or legitimate roleplay.

* You are expected to roleplay the consequences of your actions. Choosing a life of crime should meaningfully impact your character’s story, relationships, and standing within the county.

* Robbery is not meant to be risk-free. The more frequently or recklessly you rob, the more your reputation will suffer, potentially limiting future roleplay options.

***

## Final Notes

* Robbery roleplay that feels repetitive, rushed, or purely mechanical undermines immersion and may be restricted or punished.


* Always prioritize storytelling, tension, and character development over profit.
