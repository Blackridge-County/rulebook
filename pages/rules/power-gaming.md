# 🦾 Power Gaming

Powergaming is not permitted on Blackridge County. It occurs when a player uses unrealistic actions, exploits mechanics, or imposes actions on others in a way that removes their ability to react, all in order to gain an unfair or unintended advantage.

All players are expected to roleplay in a way that supports immersion, realism, and fair interaction.

## Prohibited Powergaming Behavior

* The actions listed below are considered powergaming. This list is not exhaustive:

* Repeatedly punching, shoving, or tackling without appropriate roleplay escalation.

* Disconnecting from the server during active roleplay or while incapacitated (combat logging).

* Applying restraints or initiating arrests without warning, dialogue, or roleplay setup.

* Despawning or dismissing horses and carts to prevent theft or protect inventory.

* Robbing, injuring, or killing players who are unable to respond due to menus or animations.

* Using shops, stables, fast travel, boats, hideouts, or similar systems to avoid consequences within 30 minutes of committing a crime.

* Leaving bodies in locations that prevent discovery, recovery, or proper roleplay.

* Using /me or similar commands to dictate outcomes or bypass interaction.

* Recalling a horse multiple times after it has been legitimately stolen.

* Engaging in drug sales or starting criminal activity within 30 minutes before or after a server restart.

* Using non-standard camera views (such as cinematic mode) to gain visibility or positioning advantages.

* Making abrupt or unrealistic changes to clothing, appearance, or character traits for tactical benefit.

* Playing characters with traits that negate pain, injury, or realistic limitations.

* Using emotes or animations to clip through objects, structures, or terrain.

* Moving downed or living players across the Mexico border without their consent. This is further restricted by New Life Rule (NLR) regulations regarding body interaction.

## Player Responsibility

Players must allow situations to unfold naturally and provide others with a fair chance to react. Roleplay should never be forced, rushed, or manipulated to guarantee a specific outcome.

If there is uncertainty about whether an action may constitute powergaming, players are expected to stop and seek staff guidance through a support ticket.
