# 🧠 Metagaming

Metagaming occurs when a player uses out-of-character (OOC) information—anything learned outside of in-game roleplay—to influence their character’s decisions, actions, or knowledge. This includes information gained from Discord, streams, third-party apps, or even other characters you control. Metagaming is strictly prohibited and undermines fair roleplay.

***

## General Principles

* Characters may only act on information they could reasonably know in-character.

* Knowledge gained outside of roleplay (from Discord, voice chat, streams, or other media) cannot be applied in-game.

* You may not share OOC knowledge with your character, other characters, or third parties to gain an advantage.

***

## Streams & Live Content

* Using live stream content to influence in-game actions (such as player positions, upcoming events, or loot locations) is not allowed.

* You may watch another player’s stream, but if there is any chance of overlapping in-game encounters, you must mute or deafen the stream and any voice channels during that time.

* Real-time stream information cannot be used to gain an advantage in RP or combat.

***

## Voice Channels & Communication

* Being in an unmuted or undeafened voice call (Discord, Teamspeak, etc.) while actively roleplaying is prohibited if information could influence in-character decisions.

* Exceptions: Casual conversations, resource gathering, or socializing when not engaged in active RP.

* During active RP, players must mute or deafen and cannot relay IC information to others in voice chat.

***

##Other Characters & Information Sharing

* You may not use knowledge from one character to benefit another unless it is something they would realistically know.

* Characters cannot automatically know the identities, affiliations, or locations of other characters you play.

* Sharing information between your own characters, or using third parties to transfer knowledge, is prohibited.

***

## Masked Players & Identification

* Identifying masked or disguised players solely by voice (“Voice ID”) is not allowed.

***Exceptions:***

* A player who always wears a specific outfit or mask and has previously been identified in-character.

* Public figures whose identity is known in-game.

* To avoid accidental identification, players should consider changing masks, outfits, or appearance periodically.

***

## Third-Party Sources

* Using information from Discord (server channels, private chats), forums, or other external sources to influence in-character decisions is forbidden.

* The only exception is if staff explicitly share information for IC purposes.

***

## Summary

* Only act on what your character could reasonably know in the moment.

* Avoid using any OOC knowledge from streams, chats, or other characters.
