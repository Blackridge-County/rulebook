# 🎩 Character Creation & Clothing 

When creating your character and choosing their clothing, all players are expected to adhere to the following guidelines to maintain immersion and realism in our 1890s setting:

***
## 😊 Character Names

* Names must fit the time period (1890s) and feel realistic for the era.

* Avoid unusual, modern, or fantastical names that break immersion.

* Racially inappropriate or offensive names are strictly prohibited.

***

## 💁 Appearance

* Characters must have a realistic appearance. Exaggerated, “whacky,” or cartoonish features are not allowed.

* Hair color must also reflect the era—natural shades only. Unnatural or vibrant colors are not permitted.

***

## 👘 Clothing & Outfits

* All clothing must be era-appropriate in both style and color. Bright, neon colors are not allowed.

* Outfits should reflect the roleplay your character intends to engage in. For example, a lawman, merchant, or outlaw should dress accordingly.

* Clothing should help enhance immersion and make your character believable in the world, rather than standing out in an unrealistic or distracting way.

***

## 📜 General Guidelines

* Always consider how your character’s look affects other players’ roleplay experiences.

* When in doubt, err on the side of realism and historical accuracy.

* Characters that break these rules may be required to adjust their appearance or risk administrative action.
