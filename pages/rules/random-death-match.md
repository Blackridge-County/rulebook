# 💀 Random Death Match (RDM)

Random Deathmatching (RDM) is strictly prohibited. Killing another player without clear, legitimate roleplay intent, proper escalation, or meaningful in-character interaction is not allowed under any circumstances.

If a roleplay scenario escalates to lethal force, it must be justified through prior in-character actions, such as verbal confrontation, threats, demands, or other clear hostile interactions that reasonably lead to that outcome. Players are required to properly declare hostile intent before engaging in lethal action, ensuring the opposing party has a fair opportunity to respond within the roleplay.

Any killing carried out without sufficient roleplay context, escalation, or declaration will be considered a rule violation and subject to moderation action.
