# 🏠 Housing Rules & Guidelines 

Player-owned housing provides characters with a personal space for roleplay, storage, and storytelling. Housing is a privilege, not a right, and must be used in a way that supports immersion, fairness, and server balance.

***

## 💵 Purchasing a House

* Houses may be purchased using in-county currency or supporter currency, depending on availability and server guidelines.

* All house purchases must be approved and processed through the proper in-character or staff-managed systems.

* Ownership is tied to the character, not the account, unless otherwise stated.

***

## 🕒 Activity & Ownership Status

* House ownership is expected to be actively used in roleplay.

* Prolonged inactivity may trigger a review of ownership status.

* Staff may contact an owner or monitor usage before taking action.

* Houses that are unused, abandoned, or clearly inactive may be reclaimed.

***

## ⛔ Inactivity, Departure & Auctions

* If a player leaves the county permanently or becomes significantly inactive, their house may be removed from ownership.

* Reclaimed houses may be placed into public auction, resale, or reapplication, at staff discretion.

* Former owners are not guaranteed the ability to reclaim the property unless approved by staff.

***

## ♻️ Transfers, Sales & Inheritance

* Selling or transferring a house to another player must be approved by staff.

* All sales or transfers must be roleplayed in-character and properly documented.

* Informal or unapproved transfers are not valid.

* Inheritance or gifting of houses may be permitted if supported by strong RP and staff approval.

*** 

## ❗ Use of Property & Exploitation

***Houses must not be used to exploit game mechanics, storage systems, or spawn locations.***

Using houses as:

* Safe zones to avoid RP consequences

* Log-out shelters during active scenes

* Duplication or storage exploits

***is strictly prohibited.***

Any form of mechanical abuse involving housing may result in loss of the property and further punishment.

## ⚠️ Criminal & High-Risk Roleplay

* Houses may be used for criminal or grey-area RP only if it is realistic, limited, and balanced.

* Turning a house into an unraidable, consequence-free base is not allowed.

* Staff may impose restrictions or reclaim properties being abused for high-risk activities.

***

 ## 👮 Raids, Searches & Entry

* Houses are not immune to roleplay consequences.

* Law enforcement may search or raid a property with proper RP justification (warrants, investigations, etc.).

* Owners must not exploit interiors, locks, or mechanics to avoid lawful RP outcomes.

***

##  🔨 Property Conduct & Customization

* Property customization must remain lore-friendly and appropriate to the setting.

* Blocking entrances, exploiting collision, or creating unfair advantages through decoration is prohibited.

* Staff may request changes or remove problematic modifications.

***

## ✨ Staff Oversight & Enforcement

* Staff reserve the right to:

* Review housing activity and usage

* Reclaim, freeze, or auction properties

* Remove ownership if rules are violated

* Housing-related decisions are final, though appeals may be submitted through proper channels.

***

## 📜 RP-First Philosophy

* Houses should enhance personal stories, relationships, and conflict.

* Ownership does not grant immunity from consequences or special status.

* Players are expected to prioritize roleplay quality over mechanical advantage at all times.
