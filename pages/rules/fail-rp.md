# FEAR ROLEPLAY (FearRP) & NOT VALUING LIFE (NVL)

Your character has a single life and must behave as though that life matters. Regardless of game mechanics or respawns, your character should consistently act in a way that reflects self-preservation, caution, and fear of serious harm or death.

FearRP is a core expectation of roleplay on Blackridge County.

***

## Foundational Expectations

***Players are required to:***

* Portray fear when facing credible threats, particularly when weapons are involved.

* Treat injury, capture, and death as meaningful and serious consequences.

* Act with the understanding that survival is never guaranteed.

* Consider the safety of their character and those they are closely connected to.

Reckless behavior without reasonable fear or concern for consequences may be considered Not Valuing Life (NVL).

***

## Expected Behavior

***Players must:***

* Avoid charging into gunfights or dangerous situations unless there is a believable in-character reason and a realistic chance of survival.

* Respond to active threats in towns by seeking safety, cover, or escape when possible.

* Roleplay vulnerability appropriately — no character is immune to harm, regardless of experience or reputation.

* Comply or surrender when faced with overwhelming force or clear disadvantage.

* Avoid drawing weapons or acting aggressively when held at gunpoint without a clear and realistic opening.

* Civilians are not permitted to behave as trained law enforcement or combat units during criminal incidents.

***

## Situational Guidance

* In limited engagements (such as 1v1 or 2v1), self-defense may be appropriate only when a realistic opportunity arises (e.g., the aggressor is distracted, disarmed, or lowers their weapon).

* If a threat has ended or attention is no longer focused on your character, retreating or defending yourself is acceptable within reason.

* Mechanical skill or familiarity with the game does not override FearRP expectations.

***

## Prohibited Conduct

***The following behaviors are not allowed:***

* Provoking or escalating violent situations while disregarding personal safety.
  
* Performing high-risk actions or stunts without considering injury or death.

* Inserting your character into deadly or hostile scenarios without valid in-character justification.

***

## Important Note

FearRP exists to maintain realism and meaningful tension in roleplay. Players are expected to act in good faith and prioritize immersion over advantage.

If you are uncertain how FearRP applies in a situation, pause roleplay and contact staff for clarification.
