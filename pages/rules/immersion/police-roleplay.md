# 👮 Character Interactions with the Law

Law enforcement exists to support fair, immersive roleplay. All interactions between civilians, criminals, and lawmen must prioritize realism, character consistency, and scene integrity over winning or avoiding consequences.

***

## 📕 Authority & Compliance in Roleplay

* Lawmen acting within their role have lawful authority in-character and should be treated as such.

* Civilians and criminals are not required to comply blindly, but resistance must be reasonable, justified in RP, and proportional to the situation.

* Unrealistic defiance (e.g., openly mocking officers at gunpoint with no plan or cause) may be considered powergaming.

***

## 📘 Detainment, Arrests & Searches

* Officers must provide clear in-character reasoning for detaining or arresting a player when the situation allows.

* Characters should roleplay fear, stress, or confusion when being detained, rather than immediately escalating.

* Searches must be justified through RP (probable cause, incident involvement, arrest, etc.).

* Using game mechanics to avoid a lawful arrest (disconnecting, respawning, inventory abuse) is strictly prohibited.

***

## 👊 Use of Force

* Force must always match the level of threat presented. Escalation should be gradual unless immediate danger exists.

* Deadly force is a last resort, not a default response.

* Characters should clearly roleplay warnings, commands, and intent before escalating when possible.

* “Shoot first” behavior without RP justification may be treated as fail RP.

***

## 💬 Interrogations & Questioning

* Interrogations must remain realistic and within server content boundaries.

* Torture, sexual violence, or excessively graphic threats are not permitted.

* A character may choose to remain silent or lie, but this must be roleplayed consistently and believably.

* Officers may not force confessions through OOC pressure or rule threats.

***

## 📜 Court, Sentencing & Consequences

* Arrests, fines, jail time, and other legal consequences must be roleplayed in good faith.

* Players should not treat jail or punishment as a reset button to ignore prior actions.

* Repeat or severe crimes may result in increased in-character scrutiny or punishment.

* Staff may intervene if legal outcomes are being abused or avoided through mechanics.

***

## 🔒 Jail & Custody Roleplay

* While in custody, characters must continue roleplay and respect the scene.

* Escape attempts must be realistic, planned, and properly roleplayed — not spur-of-the-moment exploits.

* Logging out, AFKing, or intentionally breaking RP while jailed is not allowed.

***

## ❌ Out-of-Character Conduct

* Do not argue rules, threaten reports, or reference staff decisions during an active scene.

* If you believe an officer or player acted improperly, finish the RP first, then submit a ticket with evidence.

* Law RP can be tense — personal insults, harassment, or saltiness OOC will not be tolerated.

***

## ❗ Scene Priority & RP First

* Winning, escaping, or avoiding charges should never take priority over a good story.

* Characters should accept losses, arrests, and consequences as part of meaningful roleplay.

* All players are expected to contribute to fair, engaging law-based RP on both sides of the badge.
