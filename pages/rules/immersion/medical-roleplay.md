# 💊Medical Roleplay & Character interactions with Doctors 

Proper medical roleplay is essential to maintaining immersion and realism in our server. All players are expected to follow these rules when injured, being treated, or interacting with medical scenarios:

***

## 😖 Roleplay Your Injuries

* React realistically to injuries. If your character is shot, stabbed, or otherwise hurt, you must act as someone in that situation would—showing pain, struggling, or being physically affected.

* Vocalization is important. Groans, cries, or other sounds of pain are required to convey your character’s condition accurately.

***

## 😭 React to Medical Treatment

* When receiving medical attention, you must roleplay reactions to procedures such as injections, broken bones being set, or other treatments. Flinching, wincing, or struggling when appropriate adds to realism.

* Do not ignore the sensations your character would naturally feel during medical care.

***

## ❗ Communication Restrictions

* You may not speak in-character unless addressing a doctor, medic, or person providing treatment. Any attempt to speak to others while incapacitated breaks immersion.

* Out-of-character information, such as who shot you or why you were injured, cannot be shared with friends or group members. Your character realistically wouldn’t have this information unless witnessed firsthand.

***

## 💭 Using /me for Immersion

* Always use /me commands to enhance medical roleplay. Examples include:

* /me starts foaming at the mouth

* /me begins to shake uncontrollably

* /me cries out in pain as the fracture is set

Your actions should reflect the severity of your injuries and the treatment being applied.

## 📜 General Guidelines

* Immersion is key. Acting as if you are fine while critically injured is not allowed.

* Cooperate with medics. Medical roleplay works best when both parties commit to realism.

* Failure to properly roleplay injuries, reactions, or treatment may result in warnings or administrative action, as it impacts the experience of all players.
