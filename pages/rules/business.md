# 🏦 Business Rules & Guidelines

Player-owned businesses are a privilege designed to create long-term roleplay, economic interaction, and story opportunities. Owning a business comes with responsibility, activity requirements, and staff oversight.

***

## 📄 Business Applications & Purchase

* All player-owned businesses must be applied for and approved by staff before ownership is granted.

* Approval is not guaranteed and may depend on roleplay quality, server needs, and past conduct.

* Once approved, the business must be purchased in-character for a set or negotiated fee.

* Attempting to operate or claim ownership of a business without approval is not allowed.

***

## 🕒 Owner Responsibilities & Activity

 Business owners are expected to be consistently active and to regularly generate roleplay through their business.

***Activity is measured by factors such as:***

* Frequency of opening the business

* Interaction with customers and other players

* Employment and management of staff

* Contribution to the server’s economy and RP

* Owner activity is monitored by staff. Businesses that exist “in name only” may be reviewed or reclaimed.

***

## ⛔ Inactivity & Business Loss

* Inactive owners may receive a warning or review at staff discretion.

* Prolonged inactivity, failure to run the business, or repeated missed openings may result in loss of ownership.

* Staff reserve the right to reclaim a business if it is no longer contributing meaningful RP.

* Loss of a business due to inactivity does not entitle the owner to a refund unless otherwise stated by staff.

***

## 💰 Selling or Transferring Ownership

* Business owners may sell or transfer their business to another player with staff approval.

* The buyer must meet eligibility requirements and may be required to submit an application.

* All sales must be roleplayed in-character and properly documented.

* Unauthorized transfers or “handshake deals” without approval are not valid.

***

## ❗ Removal of Ownership & Reapplication

* If a business is removed from an owner by staff due to rule violations, inactivity, or misuse, ownership is revoked immediately.

* If a business owner leaves the county permanently, the business will be considered vacant.

* Vacant businesses will be reopened for public application and purchase.

* Former owners are not guaranteed priority or special consideration unless approved by staff.

***

## 💥 Business Conduct & Abuse

* Businesses must operate within server rules and lore.

* Using a business primarily as a front for mechanical gain, laundering without RP, or rule abuse is prohibited.

* Businesses should not be used to bypass criminal, law, or economic systems.

* Staff may audit or intervene if a business is being abused or disrupting server balance.

***

## 👥 Employees & Management

* Business owners are responsible for the conduct of their employees while on duty.

* Hiring, firing, and managing staff must be roleplayed.

* Employees do not inherit ownership unless officially transferred and approved.

* Exploiting employees for mechanical advantage without RP is not allowed.

***

## 💵 Financial & Economic Expectations

* Business pricing should remain reasonable and lore-friendly.

* Extreme price gouging, fake scarcity, or economy manipulation may be restricted.

* Businesses are expected to participate in the wider economy, not isolate themselves.

***

## 🔑 Staff Oversight & Final Authority

* Staff reserve the right to:

* Review business activity at any time

* Temporarily freeze or permanently revoke a business

* Adjust business mechanics or ownership requirements

* Staff decisions regarding business ownership are final, though appeals may be submitted through proper channels.

***

## 📗 RP First Philosophy

* Business ownership is not about profit alone — it is about storytelling, relationships, and conflict.

* Owners are expected to accept losses, setbacks, competition, and consequences as part of roleplay.

* A well-run business that creates RP will always be valued over one that simply makes money.
