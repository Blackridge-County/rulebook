# Cheating, Expoliting & Unauthorized Mods

Any attempt to cheat, exploit, or modify the game in a way that provides an unfair advantage is strictly prohibited. Actions that compromise fairness, break roleplay immersion, or disrupt the server will result in disciplinary action, up to and including permanent bans.

***

## Exploits & Unintended Mechanics

***Players may not take advantage of game bugs, glitches, or unintended features to gain benefits or bypass normal gameplay rules. This applies to all forms of play, including:***

* Movement or positioning

* Combat or damage mechanics

* Inventory, crafting, or item duplication

* Avoiding consequences from law enforcement or roleplay events

* Earning money, items, or other in-game progression

* Using or benefiting from an exploit — even indirectly — is considered a violation.

***

## Cheating & External Programs

* The use of unauthorized software or tools to gain a gameplay advantage is strictly forbidden. This includes, but is not limited to:

* Hacks, scripts, injected resources, or altered game files

* Aimbots, triggerbots, wallhacks, ESP, or radar programs

* Modifications that increase accuracy, speed, stamina, damage, or reaction time

* External overlays or programs that give targeting or situational advantages

* Network manipulation to gain timing or sync benefits

* Any form of hacking or script injection will result in an immediate and permanent ban.

***

## Macros & Automation

* Macros are only allowed for emotes, /me commands, or other minor roleplay conveniences.

* Automating money-making, item farming, crafting, or selling is not allowed.

* Using software or hardware to automate in-game actions that provide financial or mechanical gain is a violation.

***

## Modifications

* Players may not use mods that provide a gameplay advantage, including:

* Removing shadows, foliage, fog, or other environmental cover

* Enhancing vision (night vision, increased brightness, or wall visibility)

* Altering the UI or HUD to gain tactical information

* Any change that affects damage, stamina, recoil, or movement

* Cosmetic-only mods (texture packs, skins, or visual enhancements) are allowed, as long as they provide no mechanical advantage. Any issues caused by mods are the player’s responsibility. Staff may request removal of any modification at their discretion.

***

## Economic Exploitation

* Abusing in-game systems to gain money, resources, or items faster than intended is prohibited. Examples include, but are not limited to:

* Farming or selling items at abnormal rates due to map or script bugs

* Forcing resource respawns faster than intended

* Manipulating businesses, jobs, or other systems to duplicate items or generate excessive profit

* Using macros, scripts, or third-party tools to automate item collection or sales

* If an activity produces unusually high returns or seems “too good to be true,” it should be reported immediately. Continuing to use it is considered exploiting.

***

## Bug Reporting

* Any discovered bugs, exploits, or unintended mechanics must be reported to staff immediately.

* Continuing to use an exploit after discovering it, or encouraging others to use it, is strictly forbidden.

* Failure to report exploits may result in severe penalties regardless of intent.

***

## Enforcement

***Violations may result in:***

* Character resets or wipes

* Temporary or permanent bans

* Account blacklisting

Staff decisions regarding cheating or exploiting are final.
