# 🔞 Sexual Harassment & Inappropriate Content

Sexual harassment of any kind is strictly prohibited. This includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, inappropriate comments, suggestive remarks, explicit language, gestures, images, or any other conduct of a sexual nature that may make another individual feel uncomfortable, unsafe, or create a hostile, intimidating, or offensive environment.

Non-consensual sexual content is absolutely forbidden. This includes any form of roleplay, discussion, or depiction involving sexual assault, coercion, exploitation, or non-consensual sexual acts, including but not limited to rape or attempted rape roleplay, regardless of context or intent.

Content involving suicide or self-harm is not permitted. This includes roleplay scenarios, discussions, encouragement, glorification, or depictions of suicide, self-inflicted injury, or any behavior intended to cause harm to oneself.

Violations of this policy will result in immediate moderation action, which may include warnings, temporary suspension, or permanent removal from the community, depending on severity and frequency of the offense.
