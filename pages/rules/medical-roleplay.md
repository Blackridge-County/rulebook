# 💊Medical Roleplay & Character interactions with Doctors 

Proper medical roleplay is essential to maintaining immersion and realism in our server. All players are expected to follow these rules when injured, being treated, or interacting with medical scenarios:

***

## 😖 Roleplay Your Injuries

* React realistically to injuries. If your character is shot, stabbed, or otherwise hurt, you must act as someone in that situation would—showing pain, struggling, or being physically affected.

* Vocalization is important. Groans, cries, or other sounds of pain are required to convey your character’s condition accurately.

***

## 😭 React to Medical Treatment

* When receiving medical attention, you must roleplay reactions to procedures such as injections, broken bones being set, or other treatments. Flinching, wincing, or struggling when appropriate adds to realism.

* Do not ignore the sensations your character would naturally feel during medical care.

***

## ❗ Communication Restrictions

* You may not speak in-character unless addressing a doctor, medic, or person providing treatment. Any attempt to speak to others while incapacitated breaks immersion.

* Out-of-character information, such as who shot you or why you were injured, cannot be shared with friends or group members. Your character realistically wouldn’t have this information unless witnessed firsthand.

***

## 💭 Using /me for Immersion

* Always use /me commands to enhance medical roleplay. Examples include:

* /me starts foaming at the mouth

* /me begins to shake uncontrollably

* /me cries out in pain as the fracture is set

Your actions should reflect the severity of your injuries and the treatment being applied.

***

## 📜 General Guidelines

* Immersion is key. Acting as if you are fine while critically injured is not allowed.

* Cooperate with medics. Medical roleplay works best when both parties commit to realism.

* Failure to properly roleplay injuries, reactions, or treatment may result in warnings or administrative action, as it impacts the experience of all players.



# 💉 Doctor Interaction Rules

Medical roleplay exists to support realism, consequence, and storytelling. Doctors, nurses, and medical staff play a critical role in the world and must be treated as such. All medical interactions should prioritize fair RP over mechanical advantage.

***

## 💥 Authority of Medical Staff

* Licensed medical characters have in-character authority within hospitals, clinics, and treatment scenes.

* Patients are not required to blindly comply, but refusal of treatment must be roleplayed realistically (fear, pain, mistrust, desperation, etc.).

* Ignoring medical RP entirely or treating doctors as “revive NPCs” is considered fail RP.

***

## 😖 Injuries & Treatment

* Characters must accurately roleplay injuries based on how they were sustained.

* Severe injuries (gunshots, stabbings, major trauma) require extended treatment and recovery RP, not instant fixes.

* Doctors must diagnose and treat injuries through RP rather than immediately applying mechanical healing.

* Repeatedly downplaying serious injuries may be treated as powergaming.

***

## 💤 Consciousness & Incapacitation

* Unconscious or critically injured characters may not speak, resist, or provide information until medically reasonable.

* Wounded characters should roleplay pain, disorientation, and limited movement where appropriate.

* Doctors determine when a patient is stable, conscious, or fit for release in-character.

***

## 📓 Consent & Medical Ethics

* Medical procedures require in-character consent unless the patient is unconscious or in immediate danger.

* Doctors may perform life-saving treatment without consent when necessary.

* Forced medical roleplay that crosses into sexual, humiliating, or abusive content is strictly prohibited.

* Medical RP must stay within server content rules at all times.

***

## 👮 Cooperation with Law Enforcement

* Doctors may share medical information with law enforcement only when justified in RP (court orders, public safety risks, or active investigations).

* Medical staff should not act as automatic informants or evidence tools for police.

* Patients may roleplay mistrust or refusal to cooperate with law enforcement while under care.

***

## 💀 Death & Critical Outcomes

* Doctors may pronounce a character dead if injuries are clearly unsurvivable or treatment fails.

* Medical staff should not be pressured OOC to “save” a character for convenience.

* Characters declared dead must respect death rules as defined by the server.

* Near-death survival should be rare and story-driven, not routine.

***

## 🏩 Hospital & Clinic Conduct

* Hospitals and clinics are RP-safe zones unless otherwise stated by server rules.

* Violence, weapon brandishing, or criminal activity within medical facilities must be rare and heavily justified.

* Disrupting medical RP (trolling, rushing treatment, refusing all RP) is not allowed.

***

## 💴 Corruption, Bribery & Grey-Area RP

* Medical corruption (false reports, illegal treatment, aiding criminals) is allowed only if subtle, rare, and well roleplayed.

* Doctors are not obligated to participate in corrupt RP and may refuse without OOC pressure.

* Abuse of medical roles for criminal advantage may result in character or whitelist removal.

***

## 🕒 Downtime, Recovery & Long-Term Injuries

* Serious injuries may require ongoing recovery, follow-up visits, or temporary limitations.

* Players are expected to honor doctor-imposed restrictions (bed rest, mobility limits, medication effects).

* Ignoring recovery RP to immediately return to crime or combat may be considered fail RP.

***

## ❌ Out-of-Character Expectations

* Do not rush, argue, or attempt to bypass medical RP using mechanics or OOC pressure.

* Rule disputes or concerns should be reported after the scene concludes.

* Doctors are expected to act professionally and avoid OOC favoritism.
